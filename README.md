# Website for my thesis
By the time I wrote my thesis, I decided to develop a interactive website in order to present the results of my research in user friendly and interactive fashion. But the implementation of yet another shallow-looking website was not desirable. Instead, I made an attempt to create something authentic and noticeable.

## Used technologies
* Nuxt.js (JS framework to build full-stack applications)
* Reveal.js (JS framework that allows to create awesome presentations)
* Chart.js (chart library)

## Features
* Interactive SVG map of the Russian Federation
* Dashboard that sheds the light on the scale of industries' economic losses
* Lively animated presentation with vivid functionality
* Text of my thesis as well as reviews are provied in the special section
